# Map devices

This is a simple test where I display a list of 2000 devices on a map. Each device has some information like:
- Name
- Temperature
- Is active
- Battery level

You can use the filter options to filter the data and see only those devices you are interested in.

You can find the deployed version [here](https://map-devices.netlify.com/)
